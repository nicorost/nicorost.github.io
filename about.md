Welcome!

I'm Nico, a statistician and neuroscientist working at the intersection of data science and healthcare.

After spending an exciting and very interdisciplinary orientation year in TÃ¼bingen, I was eager to center my studies around (mental) health.
This brought me into psychology in Heidelberg first, and into my master's program in neuroscience in Berlin afterwards.

Due to my interest in clinical research, I did my PhD as a computational researcher in the department of [Translational Research in Psychiatry](https://www.psych.mpg.de/1495955/binder) 
at the Max Planck Institute of Psychiatry in Munich. I was part of the [IMPRS-TP](https://www.imprs-tp.mpg.de/) and the [MMRS](https://www.en.mmrs.med.uni-muenchen.de/index.html) program. 
In my main projects, we used different machine learning techniques to refine and predict treatment outcome in major depression.

Currently, I am working as a biostatistician at [Roche Diagnostics](https://www.roche.com/) in Penzberg.

Welcome!

I'm Nico, a statistician and neuroscientist working where data science meets healthcare.

After an interdisciplinary academic year in TÃ¼bingen, I became increasingly curious about mental health. 
This led me to study psychology in Heidelberg and later pursue a master's degree in neuroscience in Berlin.

Due to my interest in clinical research, I completed my PhD as a computational researcher in the department of [Translational Research in Psychiatry](https://www.psych.mpg.de/1495955/binder) at the Max Planck Institute of Psychiatry in Munich. 
As part of the [IMPRS-TP](https://www.imprs-tp.mpg.de/) and [MMRS](https://www.en.mmrs.med.uni-muenchen.de/index.html) programs, I focused on applying machine learning techniques to refine and predict treatment outcome in major depression.

Currently, I work as a biostatistician at [Roche Diagnostics](https://www.roche.com/) in Penzberg.

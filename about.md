Welcome!

I'm Nico, a PhD Student and computational scientist in the field of computational psychiatry.

After spending an exciting and very interdisciplinary orientation year in TÃ¼bingen, I was eager to center my studies around mental health.
This brought me into psychology in Heidelberg first, and into my master's program in neuroscience in Berlin afterwards.

Due to my interest in research, statistics and data science, I am now working as a computational scientist in the department of [Translational Research in Psychiatry](https://www.psych.mpg.de/1495955/binder) 
at the Max Planck Institute of Psychiatry in Munich. In addition, I am part of the [IMPRS-TP](https://www.imprs-tp.mpg.de/) PhD program. In my main project, we use
machine learning techniques in order to get early estimations of treatment outcome in major depression. Ultimately, we aim at improving and personalizing antidepressant treatment.

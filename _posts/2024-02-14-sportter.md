Since August 2023, a friend and I have been running [Sportter](https://www.sportter.de), a **newsletter for sports events** in and around Munich.

On the first of every month, we present the most important sports highlights conveniently via email. There is also an up-to-date calendar on our website.

Subscribe to the newsletter [here](https://www.sportter.de) or follow us on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/sportter_muenchen/) for even more content.

Currently, everything is exclusively in German, but the key elements should be understandable for non-German speakers, too ;)

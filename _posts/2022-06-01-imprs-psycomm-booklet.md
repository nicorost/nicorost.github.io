In the science communication group (PsyComm) at my [grad school](https://www.imprs-tp.mpg.de/), we have created a booklet to explain mental health for everyone.

If you are interested, you can download the booklet [here](https://www.psych.mpg.de/2814459/imprs-tp). It's available in English and German.

We hope you will enjoy it!
